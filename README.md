## Description

This is a project that was made to help assist someone in viewing the weather forecast. By typing in any valid city name
you will be able to see the temperature, wind, humidity for today and the next 5 days as well as the current uv index 
for that city at the time of search. Icons are also displayed for each day to display what kind of weather to expect 
for each day. The users previous searches as also saved locally on the device so that the user simply has to click on a 
previously searched city rather than typing in the city name manually every single time.
